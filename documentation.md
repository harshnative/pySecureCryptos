# Goal

Although the python as many inbuilt modules like onetimpad , crytography , pycryptodom etc which are all great crytography modules but you need to still write a lot of boiler plate code to get the best out of them. This module combines the power of all to encrypt all types of data like strings, bytes , files etc with just few lines of code with further improving the security by adding additional salting.
