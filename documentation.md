# py Secure Cryptos

All the tools for cryptography / encryption for everything including databases , files , string , containers and another security methods like hashing and true random number generators in one place.

# Goal

Although the python as many inbuilt modules like onetimpad , crytography , pycryptodom etc which are all great crytography modules but you need to still write a lot of boiler plate code to get the best out of them. This module combines the power of all to encrypt all types of data like strings, bytes , files etc with just few lines of code with further improving the security by adding additional salting.

# Features

1. [Shuffler - shuffle and unshuffle things based on a seed](https://www.letscodeofficial.com/documentations/pySecureCryptos_shuffler#/)

used to jumble things up so that they are hard to read in correct order , used in most encryption algo's in this module.

<br>
<br>

2. [Encoder Decoder - encode and decode strings and bytes](https://www.letscodeofficial.com/documentations/pSC_encoderDecoders#/)

used to convert byte into strings and vice versa and string into byte and vice versa

<br>
<br>

3. [Onetimepad Wrapper - encrypt and decrypt strings and bytes using onetimepad](https://www.letscodeofficial.com/documentations/pSC_onetimepadWrapper#/)

you can encrypt and decrypt any string or byte with just a password. there are also generator function for tracking progress on large encryption and decryptions.

<br>
<br>


4. [Fernet Wrapper - encrypt and decrypt strings and bytes using fernet](https://www.letscodeofficial.com/documentations/pSC_fernetWrapper#/)

you can encrypt and decrypt any string or byte with just a password. there are also generator function for tracking progress on large encryption and decryptions. Better for large byte datatypes than onetimepad.
