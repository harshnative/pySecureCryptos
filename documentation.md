# Goal

Although the python as many inbuilt modules like onetimpad , crytography , pycryptodom etc which are all great crytography modules but you need to still write a lot of boiler plate code to get the best out of them. This module combines the power of all to encrypt all types of data like strings, bytes , files etc with just few lines of code with further improving the security by adding additional salting.

# Features

1. [Shuffler - shuffle and unshuffle things based on a seed](https://www.letscodeofficial.com/documentations/pySecureCryptos_shuffler#/)

used to jumble things up so that they are hard to read in correct order , used in most encryption algo's in this module.

<br>

2. [Encoder Decoder - encode and decode strings and bytes](https://www.letscodeofficial.com/documentations/pySecureCryptos_encoderDecoders#/)

used to convert byte into strings and vice versa and string into byte and vice versa
